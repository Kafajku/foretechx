# Installation
To install *foretechx* firt, I just wanted to inform you, that I've built the *foretechx* on a Windows machine.
So, after this make sure to isntall these modules first, through the ***pip install*** command in your CMD:
- keyboard
- playsound

Now, the only thing left, is to download the **foretechx.py** file (or this whole project) and place the Python file anywhere you want, then - import it.

# Modifying
I knew you will want to do this, so I've made some simple rules, when you'll be sharing modified source code of **foretechx.py**:
1. Give link to the official project's repository on GitHub.
2. Add me as a credit (for the base source code)

Upper rules might be changed through out the time

# Features
Here are some features that *foretechx* implies:
- (File buffering) Getting raw byte representation of a file (good for file sharing in e.g. F2P connection)
- Playing sounds in your Python script

And more!
