# foretechx
*foretechx* is a light, experimental library for Python.

# Installation
To install *foretechx* firt, I just wanted to inform you, that I've built the *foretechx* on a Windows machine.
So, after this make sure to isntall these modules first, through the ***pip install*** command in your CMD:
- keyboard
- playsound
Now, the only thing left, is to download the **kafalib.py** file (or this whole project) and place the Python file anywhere you want, then - import it.

# Modifying
I knew you will want to do this, so I've made some simple rules, when you'll be sharing modified source code of **kafalib.py**:
1. Give link to the official project's repository on GitHub.
2. Add me as a credit (for the base source code)
*upper rules might be changed through the time*

# Features
Here are some features that *kafalib* implies:
- (File buffering) Getting raw byte representation of a file (good for file sharing in e.g. F2P connection)
- Playing sounds in your Python script
- Key bindings
And more!
