## Installation
To install *foretechx* first, I just wanted to inform you, that I've built the *foretechx* on a Windows machine + Python version 3.8.
So, after this make sure to isntall these modules first, through the **pip install** command in your CMD:
- keyboard
- playsound

Now, the only thing left, is to download the **foretechx.py** file (or this whole project) and place the Python file anywhere you want, then - import it.

## Modifying
If you want to do this, so I've made some simple rules, when you'll be sharing modified source code of **foretechx.py**:
1. Give link to the official project's repository on GitHub.
2. Add me as a credit (for the base source code)

Upper rules might be changed through out the time

## Features
Here are some features that *foretechx* implies:
- (File buffering) Getting raw byte representation of a file (good for file sharing in e.g. F2P connection)
- Playing sounds in your Python script
- Key bindings

And more!
